        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Kenneth Ward Jr., a photographer, videographer, and aspiring web developer. My journey began with a passion for visual storytelling, which has led me to work on various creative projects, including music videos, interviews, and promotional content for non-profit organizations. I am the founder of Junior Ward Productions, where I provide independent photography and videography services. My work extends to non-profits like Code Tenderloin and East Oakland Youth Development Centre, where I use my creative skills to create powerful media that supports their missions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working at GLIDE Foundation, where I contribute to both social media content creation and web development. I manage the organization’s online presence by creating visuals and updating the website to enhance user experience. My web development journey started as a way to expand my skillset and provide even more impactful services to the organizations I care about. My focus is on learning new technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and API integration. This knowledge allows me to combine my creativity with technical skills to create engaging, responsive web content.
